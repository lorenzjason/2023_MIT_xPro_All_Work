    "## The Central Limit Theorem\n",
    "\n",
    "The central limit theorem (CLT) is an fundamental theorem of statistics that lays the foundations for undarstanding the results of *sampling*.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Formal Definition\n",
    "\n",
    "The central limit theorem (CLT) states that the distribution of a sample variable approximates a normal distribution  as the *sample* size becomes larger, assuming that all *samples* are identical in size and regardless of the population's actual distribution shape.\n",
    "\n",
    "In other words, according to the CLT, the mean of a *sample* of data will be closer to the mean of the overall population in question, as the *sample* size increases.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Terms \n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine performing a *trial*  and getting an *observation*. Next, imagine repeating the *trial* again and get a new independent *observation*. Collected together, multiple *observations* represents a *sample* of *observations*.\n",
    "\n",
    "As you know, a sample is a group of *observations* from a broader *population*.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's first understand the differences between the words *observation*, *sample*, and *population*:\n",
    "\n",
    "- *Observation*: is the result from one *trial* of an experiment.\n",
    "- *Sample*: is the roup of results gathered from separate independent *trials*.\n",
    "- *Population*: Is the space of all possible observations that could be seen from a trial.\n",
    "\n",
    "The mean of a *sample* won't be exactly the same mean of the *population* distribution: like any estimate, it will be wrong and will contain some error. However, if you draw multiple independent *samples* and calculate their means, the distribution of those means will form a Gaussian distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Takeaways\n",
    "\n",
    "Without going too depp into the mathematical details of the CLT, here are some fundamental takeways from it:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- The CLT states that the distribution of *sample* means approximates a normal distribution as the sample size gets larger, regardless of the *population*'s distribution.\n",
    "- Sample sizes equal to or greater than **30** are often considered sufficient for the CLT to hold.\n",
    "- The average of the means and standard deviations of the *sample* will equal the mean and standard deviation of the *population*.\n"
