The dataset is managed by the US Census Bureau and our set is from 1992-2021(present). To analyze the data, I needed to first extract the data into a format that I can use to clean it up and organize it. I chose to export as a CSV file and reshape the data from there. After looking at the original data, I decided to only use the non adjusted data because there are more business types represented and a total at the end to use for data validation after loading.
